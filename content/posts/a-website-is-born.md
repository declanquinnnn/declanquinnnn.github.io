Okay well I've got this here website up and running. Here's a screenshot in
case things change a bit since this has been written:

It certainly ain't much, but it'll be more than fine for now. I don't think
that there's all that much to do on it for now other than using it as a space
to put stuff and link to tools or whatever. The only items outstanding atm are:
 - Linking it to a custom domain
 - Adding this post
 - Figuring out why GitHub won't let me use the default font that shows up in
   local production

Though I am sure that I will figure out some other things to do along the way!

So what's next.

Options:
 - Working on this company that might be a thing
 - Reaching out to start-ups re. business opportunitiies
 - Updating my resume
 - Figuring out how I could live in Europe for the next couple of months (or
   some other digital nomad-y place)
